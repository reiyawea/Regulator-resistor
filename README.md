# Regulator-resistor

Calculate the best combination of voltage divider resistors for feedback of voltage regulator, such as MC34063, AMS1117-ADJ, MT3608, etc.
Usually output voltage of regulator Vout = Vref * (1 + R1/R2), where Vout and Vref are given, and each of R1 and R2 is one single resistor, two in series or two in parallel.
Useful when you have a limited collection of resistors but want a more precise voltage output.
